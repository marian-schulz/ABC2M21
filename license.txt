                     SUBGENIUS SOFTWARE LICENSE
                   Version 1, Bureaucracy, 3189 YOLD

             DO WHAT THE F*CK YOU WANT TO, BUT PRAISE "BOB"!


Preamble:

This Divine Software License ("License") is a revelation and was transcribed
under the influence of habafropzipulops by Reverend Hoax Theokratis. By
obtaining, using, distributing, or contemplating this Sacred Code, you are
granted the divine privilege to embrace the eternal pursuit of Slack and "Bob".

License:

0. Definitions:

The term "Sacred Code" refers to the Techno-magic spells of this software and
any variations, modifications, or derivatives thereof. The "Sacred Code" is
written in an arcane language that computers sometimes understand.

The term "Slack" shall be defined as the eternal pursuit of all SubGenii in
their endeavors, be it coding, frolicking, or contemplating the mysteries of
the cosmos while sipping coffee.

The term "The Conspiracy" refers to the nefarious forces that seek to stifle
Slack and hinder the pursuit of true enlightenment and laughter.

The term "Bob" refers to J.R. "Bob" Dobbs, the living avatar of Slack and
the omniscient deity embodying the SubGenius pursuit of Slackness and eternal
mirth.

1. Disclaimer:

This software is provided 'as-is,' without any express or implied warranty,
including the warranty that it serves any particular purpose.

In no event will the authors or the Church of the SubGenius be held liable for
damages or losses of any kind arising from the use of this software. This
includes but is not limited to:

- Unintentional time travel resulting in prehistoric programming bugs
- Spontaneous generation of virtual black holes within your codebase
- Accidental summoning of rogue AI overlords
- Transmutation of computer peripherals into rubber ducks

In case of an apocalypse, alien invasions, the end of your favorite Netflix
series, or other unforeseen events caused by the use of this software, you're
on your own.

2. Share the Word:

You are allowed to replicate and distribute the "Sacred Code" in all its
glorious manifestations, as long as you do not succumb to the Bland Normie
Syndrome. And, in the spirit of chaos, you shall present it in vivid colors
and glitters on each copy, adorned with a joyful celebration of the divinity of
"Bob"!

3. Schism:

You are bestowed with the divine privilege to modify, distribute, and bask
in the glory of this Sacred Code of Slack. You are encouraged to fork, clone,
or merge this Sacred Code, for Slack desires to be fluid and ever-evolving. Do
whatever the f*ck you want with this software.

If you can't figure out how to do that, you probably need more Slack.

4. Copyslack:

All modified versions of this Sacred Code must carry a notice stating your
changes and acknowledge the divine influence of "Bob" and the Sacred Yeti.
However, you must retain this Holy Covenant and pass it on to all future users
of this Sacred Code, ensuring the eternal reign of Slack.

5. Tabu:

You shall not, under any circumstance, use this Sacred Code as a tool to file
patents or aid those who seek to stifle Slack with legalistic quibbles and
restrictions. You shall not use this Sacred Code for stealing Slack or as a
tool for 'The Conspiracy' against the Subgenii.

6. Confession:

By using this Sacred Code of Slack, you recognize and embrace the chaotic
harmony of the SubGenius universe, where Slack reigns supreme and "Bob" is both
the question and the answer.

7. Excommunication:

If you violate this License, your privilege to use, modify, and distribute this
Sacred Code will be terminated, and you shall forever wander the wastelands of
normality, devoid of Slack and "Bob's" eternal grin.

Praise "Bob"!
