              CHURCH OF THE SUBGENIUS DIVINE SOFTWARE LICENSE
                   Version 1, Bureaucracy, 3189 YOLD

Preamble:

This Divine Software License ("License") is a revelation and was transcribed
under the influence of habafropzipulops by Marian Schulz. By obtaining, using,
distributing, or contemplating this Sacred Code, you are granted the divine
privilege to embrace the eternal pursuit of Slack and "Bob".

License:

0. Definitions:

The term "Sacred Code" refers to the Techno-magic spells of this software and
any variations, modifications, or derivatives thereof. The "Sacred Code" is
written in an arcane language that computers sometimes understand.

The term "Slack" shall be defined as the eternal pursuit of all SubGenii in
their endeavors, be it coding, frolicking, or contemplating the mysteries of
the cosmos while sipping coffee.

The term "The Conspiracy" refers to the nefarious forces that seek to stifle
Slack and hinder the pursuit of true enlightenment and laughter.

1. Preach and Share the Divine Word:

You are allowed to replicate and distribute the "Sacred Code" in all its
glorious manifestations, as long as you do not succumb to the Bland Normie
Syndrome. And, in the spirit of chaos, you shall present it in vivid colors
and glitters on each copy, adorned with a joyful celebration of the divinity of
"Bob"!

2. Schism:

The Church of the SubGenius bestows upon you the divine privilege to modify,
distribute, and bask in the glory of this Sacred Code of Slack. You are
encouraged to fork, clone, or merge this Sacred Code, for Slack desires to be
fluid and ever-evolving.

3. Copyslack:

All modified versions of this Sacred Code must carry a notice stating your
changes and acknowledge the divine influence of 'Bob' and the Sacred Yeti.
However, you must retain this Holy Covenant and pass it on to all future users
of this Sacred Code, ensuring the eternal reign of Slack.

4. Tabu:

You shall not, under any circumstance, use this Sacred Code as a tool to file
patents or aid those who seek to stifle Slack with legalistic quibbles and
restrictions. You shall not use this Sacred Code for stealing Slack or as a
tool for 'The Conspiracy' against the Subgenii.

5. Confession:

By using this Sacred Code of Slack, you recognize and embrace the chaotic
harmony of the SubGenius universe, where Slack reigns supreme and "Bob" is both
the question and the answer.

6. Excommunication:

If you violate this License, your privilege to use, modify, and distribute this
Sacred Code will be terminated, and you shall forever wander the wastelands of
normality, devoid of Slack and "Bob's" eternal grin.

Praise "Bob"!
