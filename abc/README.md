# ABC Tunes for Testing ABC2M21 Implementation

Most of this these compositions consist of multi-voiced ABC tunes (chorales) utilized for testing the ABC2M21 
implementation.

The tunes have primarily been transcribed into ABC by Guido Gonzato and have been sourced by me from the
[ABC Plus Project](https://abcplus.sourceforge.net). 

Thanks to Guido Gonzato for making these tunes freely available.
